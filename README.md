# Excel-Dashboard
This report outlines the steps to create an Excel dashboard using a sample bike buyer dataset. The dashboard will include various visualizations and filters to analyze the data and gain insights into bike purchasing behavior.

# Data Acquisition and Cleaning:
1. Download the sample bike buyer dataset from the instructor's GitHub repository.
2. Import the data into Excel and create a working sheet to avoid overwriting the original data.
3. Remove duplicate entries using the "Remove Duplicates" feature.
4. Clean and format the data by:
o Replacing abbreviations for marital status and gender with full words (e.g., M/S to Married/Single, M/F to Male/Female).
o Ensuring consistency in currency formatting for income.
o Combining similar commute distance ranges if necessary.
o Creating age brackets to condense the age data.  
# Pivot Tables and Visualizations:
1. Create a pivot table to analyze the average income of bike buyers by gender and purchase decision.
2. Create a bar chart to visualize the average income data, with appropriate chart title and data labels.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 to create additional pivot tables and visualizations for other insights, such as:
o Average commute distance by purchase decision.
o Distribution of bike buyers by education level and region.
# Dashboard Design and Functionality:  
1. Arrange the pivot tables and visualizations on the dashboard for clear and organized presentation.
2. Apply consistent formatting and color schemes for visual appeal.
3. Utilize slicers to filter the data by demographics like marital status, region, and education level. This allows for deeper analysis of specific segments.  
# Project Outcome:  
The completed Excel dashboard will provide valuable insights into the bike buyer dataset, enabling you to:
• Identify trends in bike purchasing behavior based on demographics and income.
• Understand the relationship between commute distance and bike purchases.
• Analyze the distribution of bike buyers across different educational backgrounds and regions.
